# Freelancer Ranking Algorithms

This document explains the sophisticated algorithms used to rank and categorize freelancers on the platform.

## Overview

Our ranking system uses multi-factor weighted scoring algorithms that consider various aspects of freelancer performance, reliability, and market demand. Each category serves a different purpose and uses tailored criteria.

## 1. Top Freelancers Algorithm

**Purpose**: Identify the highest-performing freelancers with proven track records.

### Scoring Components (Total: 100 points)

#### Rating Score (40% weight)
- **Formula**: `(rating / 5.0) * 40`
- **Logic**: Direct correlation between user rating and score
- **Max Points**: 40 (for 5.0 rating)

#### Experience Score (25% weight)
- **Formula**: `min(completed_projects / 10, 1) * 25`
- **Logic**: Rewards experience, caps at 10 completed projects for fairness
- **Max Points**: 25 (for 10+ completed projects)

#### Success Rate Score (20% weight)
- **Formula**: `(accepted_proposals / total_proposals) * 20`
- **Logic**: Measures proposal acceptance rate as indicator of quality
- **Max Points**: 20 (for 100% acceptance rate)

#### Recent Activity Bonus (10% weight)
- **Formula**: Binary bonus for activity in last 30 days
- **Logic**: Rewards active freelancers who are currently engaged
- **Max Points**: 10 (if active in last 30 days)

#### Profile Completeness (5% weight)
- **Formula**: `(completeness_percentage / 100) * 5`
- **Logic**: Encourages complete, professional profiles
- **Components**: Bio (20%), Skills (20%), Hourly Rate (20%), Location (20%), Avatar (20%)
- **Max Points**: 5 (for 100% complete profile)

### Minimum Requirements
- Rating ≥ 3.5
- At least 1 proposal submitted

## 2. Newcomer Freelancers Algorithm

**Purpose**: Identify promising new talent with potential for growth.

### Scoring Components (Total: 100 points)

#### Recency Score (30% weight)
- **Logic**: More recent joiners get higher priority
- **Scoring**:
  - ≤7 days: 30 points
  - ≤30 days: 25 points
  - ≤60 days: 15 points
  - ≤90 days: 5 points

#### Early Activity Score (25% weight)
- **Logic**: Rewards freelancers who started proposing quickly after joining
- **Scoring**:
  - 3+ proposals in first week: 25 points
  - 1+ proposals in first week: 15 points
  - 1+ proposals total: 10 points
  - No proposals: 0 points

#### Profile Quality Score (25% weight)
- **Formula**: Same as profile completeness in Top Freelancers
- **Logic**: Professional presentation indicates seriousness

#### Initial Success Score (20% weight)
- **Logic**: Early wins indicate potential
- **Scoring**:
  - 1+ accepted proposal: 20 points
  - 3+ total proposals: 10 points
  - 1+ total proposals: 5 points
  - No proposals: 0 points

### Minimum Requirements
- Joined within last 90 days
- Profile completeness ≥ 40%

## 3. Featured Freelancers Algorithm

**Purpose**: Showcase a balanced mix of high performers and rising stars with market relevance.

### Scoring Components (Total: 100 points)

#### Overall Performance (30% weight)
- **Rating Component (40% of performance)**: `(rating / 5.0) * 12`
- **Success Rate Component (35% of performance)**: `(success_rate / 100) * 10.5`
- **Experience Component (25% of performance)**: `min(completed_projects / 5, 1) * 7.5`

#### Market Demand (25% weight)
- **High-Demand Skills**: 5 points per skill (React, Python, JavaScript, Design)
- **Competitive Pricing**:
  - ≤$50/hr: 10 points
  - ≤$100/hr: 7.5 points
  - >$100/hr: 5 points
- **Skill Diversity**:
  - 5+ skills: 10 points
  - 3+ skills: 5 points

#### Reliability (20% weight)
- **Completion Rate**: `(completed_projects / accepted_proposals) * 10`
- **Consistent Activity**:
  - 3+ proposals in 90 days: 10 points
  - 1+ proposals in 90 days: 5 points

#### Professional Presence (15% weight)
- **Profile Completeness**: `(completeness / 100) * 10`
- **Portfolio Demos**:
  - 2+ video demos: 5 points
  - 1+ video demos: 2.5 points

#### Client Satisfaction (10% weight)
- **Recent Demand Indicator**:
  - 2+ proposals in 30 days: 10 points
  - 1+ proposals in 30 days: 5 points

### Minimum Requirements
- Rating ≥ 3.0
- At least 1 proposal submitted
- Profile completeness ≥ 60%
